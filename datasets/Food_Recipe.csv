Get all the ingredients ready and get your butter cut into small pea size pieces.The next step is to make the dough for the pie crust. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, and sugar. Add the butter into the flour mixture.Work the butter into the flour with your fingers until the mixture resembles a coarse meal. When you hold the flour together, it should hold tight and when you let it loose, it will fall apart.Sprinkle ice water onto the flour and butter mixture.  Using your hands push the dough from the sides to the middle of the bowl to form a ball that holds together.Make sure to add little water at a time, as the heat from your hands will melt the butter and help form the dough as well.You can transfer the pie dough on to a work surface and knead the dough until all the flour has come together to form a smooth dough.Once done, wrap the dough in a cling film or a plastic wrap and refrigerate it for a couple of hours. This refrigeration process helps to give the pie crust a flaky texture.To make the filling, grind the ingredients for Recheado masala in a mixer grinder to a smooth paste and keep it aside.Heat a kadai with oil, add chopped onions and saute till they turn translucent. Add in tomatoes and saute till it becomes mushy and soft.Add your ground recheado masala and keep sautéing until the raw smell from the masala goes away. Add chopped prawns at the end, sprinkle with little salt and cook until the prawns curl up and switch off the flame immediately.  Set aside the filling to cool, pre heat the oven to 180 degree Celsius to 10 minutes and leave it aside. Remove the dough from the refrigerator to start rolling.On a generously floured surface, Divide the dough into two equal parts, gently flatten the ball of the dough with a rolling pin. Starting from the center, roll the dough into a circle about an inch larger than the diameter of the pan that you plan to use.Once rolled out lift the dough into the pan. Fold the edges under and crimp with your fingers or a fork.Blind bake the pie crust in the oven for about 5 minutes and take it out. Add the filling inside and flatten it.Roll out the other half of the pie crust pastry as flat and big as possible, in order to cover the tart on top. Carefully lift the dough and place it on top of the pie and cut of the extras from the ends. By using a forst poke holes on top.Bake it in the oven at 180 degree Celsius for over 30 minutes till you get a nice crispy crust on top.

Rice cooks in this resting period, hence wait for the pressure to release completely.While we are waiting for the pressure to release, Lets proceed to make the seasoning.For seasoning the Bisi Bele Bath, heat a small pan on medium heat. Add in a tablespoon of ghee and allow it to melt. Add in the mustard seeds, the cumin seeds. Allow it to crackle. Then add in the red chilli, curry leaves and roast them until the red chillies are browned lightly. Stir to roast the ingredients well.

We will henceforth refer to this arrangement as bain-marie.In the bain-marie, melt bite size pieces of chocolate and butter until a smooth mixture is formed. We will now take the bowl off heat and set it aside until partially cooled.Meanwhile, let's separate the egg whites and the yolks. Beat the egg whites with an electric beater or wire whisk until stiff peaks are formed.Note: If you plan to make this recipe eggless (egg free) then prepare the Flax meal Egg Replacer and keep it aside.When the chocolate mixture cools, fold in the sugar, ground almonds, vanilla essence and egg yolks with a rubber spatula. Note: Add the Flax meal Egg Replacer at the above stage.Further, fold the beaten egg whites gently into the chocolate mixture by taking care, not to deflate the egg-chocolate mixture. This step is crucial to help maintain the consistency of the mud pie.  (Skip this step for egg free cake)Now, we shall pour the chocolate mixture into a lined and greased spring foam tin and bake in a preheated 180C oven for 30 to 35 minutes until just set. You will notice when a tester like a pick or a knife inserted into the center comes almost clean, but not completely. The mud pies most often will have a few cake crumbs that get stuck to the center, but it's not raw.Once the mud pie is baked, remove the cake from the oven and allow it to cool. Take care to unmould the cake only when completely cooled.An optional step would be to whip up a simple chocolate ganache and slather it all over the mud pie.I also topped it with store bought peanut brittle to give it a little crunch. Butterscotch will work wonders too.Serve the Flourless Chocolate Mud Pie chilled or at room temperature for your parties or even as a tea time snack",https://www.archanaskitchen.com/images/archanaskitchen/1-Author/Shyma_Menon/Flourless_Chocolate_Mud_Pie_Recipe.jpg

First cut the eggplants into 1/2 inch thick slices. Sprinkle some salt and keep it aside in a colander for about an hour.After an hour, dry the eggplants using a kitchen towel. The next step is to cook the eggplants.Preheat a skillet on medium heat, grease the pan with oil and place the sliced eggplants in the oil and cook them until browned and soft on both sides. Once cooked, place them on a paper towel to drain the excess oil.Cooking the eggplants on the skillet, gives it a soft texture as opposed to baking them in the oven.

Stir in the chopped coriander leaves.For the bechamel sauce, add all the ingredients into a saucepan and cook the sauce until it thickens. Once the sauce is thick, turn off the heat and keep the sauce aside.Our final step to make the moussaka is to assemble the dish and bake it in the oven.In a greased baking dish, sprinkle some breadcrumbs, this will help absorb the extra juices that come out when baking the moussaka.Place a layer of cooked eggplants at the bottom, pour some mushroom sauce over this later. Next layer it with eggplants again and pour the bechamel sauce over. Finally sprinkle it with cheese on the top.Bake the moussaka in the preheated oven for about 20 minutes until the cheese melts and turns golden brown. Once done, remove from the oven and allow it to rest for about 10 minutes before you serve.Serve the Eggplant Moussaka with a Crusty Garlic Bread and a salad by the side.",https://www.archanaskitchen.com/images/archanaskitchen/World_Gourmet_Recipes/Vegetarian_Greek_Eggplant_Moussake_in_Mushroom_Sauce-3.jpg
